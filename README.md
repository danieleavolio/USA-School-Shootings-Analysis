# US School Shootings Analysis
## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the trend and pattern of school shootings in the USA through data warehousing and advanced data analytics techniques. The project is based on the dataset from Kaggle.

## Steps Carried Out
1. Data Collection:

- The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and it includes information on school shootings in the USA from 1970 to 2022. The data includes various factors such as location, weapons used, motive, and number of casualties.

2. Data Preprocessing:

- The data was preprocessed using Pentaho to clean, transform, and perform basic ETL procedures. The aim of this step was to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate records.
- The following tasks were performed during the data preprocessing stage:
    - Data cleaning to remove any inaccuracies and outliers
    - Data transformation to convert data into the required format
    - Basic ETL procedures to load the data into the data warehouse
3. Data Warehouse Creation:

- The cleaned data was then loaded into a data warehouse to prepare it for analysis. A data warehouse was chosen as it is optimized for analytical processing and enables the storage of large amounts of data.
- During this step, the data was organized and structured to ensure it was ready for analysis.

4. Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Tableau was used for data analysis and visualization to gain insights and understand the pattern and trend of school shootings in the USA.
- The following tasks were performed during the data analysis and visualization stage:
  -   Data exploration to understand the distribution and relationship of the data
  -   Data visualization to display the data in a meaningful way
  -   Data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data

5. Conclusions:

- The insights obtained from the data analysis were used to draw conclusions and provide recommendations for preventing future school shootings. The data was analyzed to identify factors that may have contributed to school shootings and to understand the trend and pattern of school shootings in the USA.
- Based on the findings, recommendations were made to improve school safety and prevent future school shootings.

## Summary
This project provides valuable insights into the trend and pattern of school shootings in the USA and can assist in the development of targeted prevention strategies to improve the safety of schools. The analysis was carried out using a combination of data warehousing and advanced data analytics techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of the issue.
